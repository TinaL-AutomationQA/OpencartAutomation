# Selenium Test Automation Framework 

## Overview

This is a hybrid automation testing framework built using **Selenium**, **TestNG**, and **ExtentReports**. It is designed to test web applications with a focus on scalability, reusability, and maintainability. The framework supports key testing scenarios, including functional testing, regression testing, and data-driven testing.

This framework was developed as part of my self-learning journey to enhance my skills in automation testing.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates web elements and actions for better code organization and reuse.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Integrates with Apache POI to dynamically read test data from Excel files.
- **Test Reporting**: Generates detailed HTML reports using ExtentReports, including test results, logs, and screenshots for failed tests.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized management of test settings using `config.properties`.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- **Logging**: Configured with Log4j for detailed execution logs.

## How to Use

- Clone the Repository
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/TinaL-AutomationQA/OpencartAutomation.git
```
- Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
- Configure the config.properties file:
- Set the browser type (e.g., chrome).
- Set the application URL.
- Run the desired TestNG XML file (e.g., testng.xml) to execute the test suite.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver
- Test Management: TestNG
- Reporting: ExtentReports
- Data Handling: Apache POI (Excel)
- Build Tool: Maven
- Logging: Log4j


## Test Reports
The framework generates detailed HTML reports using ExtentReports. Reports include:

Test execution status (Pass/Fail/Skip).
Failure details with screenshots.
Logs for debugging.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
- Add support for API testing with RestAssured or Postman.
- Implement Dockerized Selenium Grid for easier remote execution.
